# HexMapBuilder
Hexagonal Tile based map builder for "hex-crawl" type games // W.I.P.

This project is still in its most basic form, and a lot of intended features have not yet  been implemented.

So far you can:
- draw a map of 100x100 size,
- place symbols on hex-tiles,
- save and load it via Object Imput and Output Stream,

Upcoming features:
- exporting maps to .png files,
- ability to save more than one map (map saving is still in it's infancy)

This project utilizes:
- Java SDK 11
- JavaFX 11
- My basic understanding of Mavem/Spring  *insert "I have no idea what I'm doing" dog meme here*
